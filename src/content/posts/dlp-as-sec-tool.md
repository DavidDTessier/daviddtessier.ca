title: "Data Loss Prevention: Keeping Your Crown Jewels Safe in the Digital Age"
description: A comprehensive look at Data Loss Prevention solutions
---

I had originally written a post on **SADA's** [Engineering Blog](https://engineering.sada.com/cloud-dlp-as-an-essential-security-tool-33aef9a780d4) where I talked briefly on what Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is and why it is an essential security tool; as well I provided a simple a use case for Google Cloud Platform's Cloud DLP.

In this post I wanted to expand on the topic of DLP in general and to really ask the questions "What is Data Loss Prevention and why should we use it?".

## What is Data Loss Prevention?

Data is the lifeblood of any organization. It holds financial records, customer information, intellectual property, and a wealth of other sensitive details. Protecting this data from unauthorized access, leaks, and breaches is paramount. This is where Data Loss Prevention (DLP) comes in.

**_Data Loss Prevention_** or DLP for short, is a set security tools and procedures that work together that your organization can use to protect itself from theft of data, breaches, inadvertent or malicious loss of data, and/or unauthorized access, sharing, transfer, and manipulation of sensitive data. These tools use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as well as automation to monitor, protect, and prevent data breaches/leaks of sensitive information across various platforms, whether on-premise of in the cloud

These tools also allow your organization to achieve compliance with regulations such as the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**, **General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)**, and **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**.

DLP can be deployed across various data states:

* **Data at rest**:
  * This refers to data stored on servers, databases, and employee devices. DLP can encrypt data at rest, making it unreadable even if accessed by unauthorized users.
* **Data in motion**:
  * This is data being transferred across networks, like emails or file uploads. DLP can scan for sensitive information in outgoing traffic and block transmissions that violate security policies.
* **Data in use**:
  * This refers to data being actively used by employees. DLP can monitor applications and user behavior to prevent accidental or malicious data leaks.

DLP technologies typically support one or more of the following cybersecurity activities:

* **Prevention**:
  * Establish a real-time review of data streams and immediately restrict suspicious activity or unauthorized users
* **Detection**:
  * Quickly identify anomalous activity through improved data visibility and enhanced data monitoring measures
* **Response**:
  * Streamline incident response activities by tracking and reporting data access and movement across the enterprise
* **Analysis**:
  * Contextualize high-risk activity or behavior for security teams to strengthen prevention measures or inform remediation activities

## Why is DLP so important, and Why is it needed?

As I mentioned in my previous article, DLP is an essential tool in your arsenal to protect your organizations sensitive information as well as aid in organizational risk reduction strategy. This is especially true when it comes to protecting and securing endpoint devices such as mobile devices, desktop/laptop computers, and servers.

In the [2023 Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR)](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T178/reports/2023-dbir-executive-summary.pdf) from Verizon _**recaps the number of global data breaches and cyber attacks in 2023. According to this report there was around 5,119 confirmed data breach reported which is slightly lower than the number of breaches in the previous years report of which was 5,212**_. 

Another report from the [Physicians Practice](https://www.physicianspractice.com/view/2023-saw-twice-as-many-patient-data-breaches) _**indicates that 2023 saw twice as many patient data breaches compared to 2022**_.

These numbers increasingly grow year over year which is very alarming especially as we start to see the growing adoption of Gen AI and AI based attacks and why having proper security control in place is so important.

Another prime example of poor security controls is the October 2023 attack on Marina Bay Sands Resort as highlighted in the following [article](https://cybermagazine.com/operational-security/marina-bay-sands-data-breach-highlights-need-for-edr) and why tools like DLP and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) are ever more important.

All of these attacks, incidents, and data breaches could have been prevented and/or minimized with the right security controls, tooling (such as DLP) and proper security training in place.

Data breaches are a constant threat, and the consequences can be severe.  

Data leaks can happen due to a variety of reasons, but unlike what you might think, it's not always malicious hackers. Here are the a few of main culprits:

* **Human error and weak security practices**:
  * This can include things like weak passwords, improperly configured systems, or even accidentally sending data to the wrong person.
* **Insider threats**:
  * Sometimes employees, contractors, or even temporary workers with access to sensitive data can be the ones who leak it, either intentionally or unintentionally.
* **Outdated software**:
  * Software with known vulnerabilities is a prime target for hackers who can exploit those weaknesses to gain access to data.
* **Exfiltration**:
  * Data exfiltration is the process of stealing or transferring data from a network and/or device.
  * Can be done by outsiders or insiders performing cyber attacks such as phishing or DDoS attacks.
  * Data which is typically exfiltrated includes login credentials and intellectual property

A data breach can result in:

* **Financial losses**:
  * Organizations can face hefty fines for non-compliance with data privacy regulations.
* **Reputational damage**:
  * A data breach can seriously erode customer trust and brand reputation.
* **Loss of competitive advantage**:
  * Stolen intellectual property can give competitors a significant edge.

DLP helps mitigate these risks by providing an extra layer of security for your sensitive data.

## Benefits of a DLP Solution

The following are some key benefits that a DLP solution brings to your organization's security profile.

* **Enhanced data security**:
  * DLP helps prevent unauthorized access, leaks, and breaches of sensitive data.
* **Improved regulatory compliance**:
  * DLP can help organizations meet the requirements of data privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
* **Reduced risk of financial loss**:
  * By preventing data breaches, DLP can help organizations avoid costly fines and penalties.
* **Increased productivity**:
  * With robust data security in place, employees can focus on their work without worrying about data leaks.

## DLP policy adoption and deployment best practices

Due to the intricate nature of the threat landscape and the complex nature of most corporate networks, the first step in implementing a DLP policy is often to identify a trusted and capable cybersecurity partner. Whether your organization uses a third-party cybersecurity partner or keeps it in house, having a dedicated team of knowledgeable security professionals will be critical in helping the business at every stage of the program, from strategy and design to implementation and operation.

Below are some best practice guidelines to help organizations maximize their DLP investment and ensure the chosen solution aligns to their security strategy and measures:

1. **Data Classification**:
    * Identify and classify your sensitive data (financial records, customer data, intellectual property). This helps prioritize DLP efforts.
2. **Risk Assessment**:
    * Understand the potential risks to your data. This includes insider threats, malware, and accidental leaks.
3. **Policy Development**:
    * Create clear policies on data handling, access control, and acceptable use. Ensure alignment with compliance regulations.
4. **Stakeholder Identification & Engagement**:
    * Get buy-in from key players including, but is not limited to, IT security, legal, HR, and business unit representatives.
    * Their involvement ensures the DLP strategy aligns with business needs and regulations.
5. **DLP Tool Selection**:
    * Research and choose a DLP solution that fits your organizational needs.
    * Consider factors like budget, data types, deployment options (cloud, on-premise).
6. **DLP Implementation Plan**:
    * Once a DLP solution is procured, IT develops an implementation plan to roll out the DLP solution which includes, but not limited to, the following:
        * start state, desired end state and steps to get from one to the other
        * steps on how discovery of sensitive items works
        * development of policies and the order in which they will be implemented
        * how any prerequisites will be addressed
        * a plan for how you'll simulate policies before implementing them for enforcement
        * a plan for how you'll train your end users
        * a plan for how you'll tune your policies
        * a plan for how you'll review and update your data loss prevention strategy based on changing regulatory, legal, industry standard, or intellectual property protection and business needs
7. **Data Discovery and Monitoring**:
    * Implement the DLP tool to discover and monitor sensitive data across endpoints, networks, and storage systems.
8. **Control Selection**:
    * Define DLP controls based on identified risks and policies. This could include content inspection, encryption, data transfer restrictions.
9. **User Training and Awareness**:
    * Educate employees about DLP policies and how the DLP tool works. Foster a culture of data security.
10. **Testing and Refinement**:
    * Continuously test your DLP solution to ensure effectiveness. Monitor logs and refine rules as needed.

The following is merely a guideline for a typical DLP implementation:

* **Phase 1 (1-2 Months)**:
  * Data classification, risk assessment, policy development.
* **Phase 2 (2-3 Months)**:
  * DLP tool selection, pilot deployment with a small test group.
* **Phase 3 (2-4 Months)**:
  * User training, DLP tool rollout across the organization, policy enforcement.
* **Phase 4 (Ongoing)**:
  * Continuous monitoring, log analysis, DLP rule adjustments, user awareness campaigns.

This is above steps are a general framework, adapt it to your organization's specific needs and involve key stakeholders from IT, security, and legal departments as needed.

Always communicate the DLP strategy clearly to gain user buy-in.

By following these steps and implementing a well-defined plan, you can effectively adopt a DLP tool and strategy to safeguard your sensitive data.
